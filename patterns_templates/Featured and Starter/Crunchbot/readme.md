# Crunchbot - Replacing a SQL analyst with 26 recursive GPT prompts

A slack bot that uses GTP-3 to generate SQL from free-form analytics texts

The Crunchbot app takes in a free-form analytics query via Slack (e.g "How many seed rounds happened in 2022?") and uses GPT-3 to generate SQL and return the answer via Slack. See blog post for details: https://www.patterns.app/blog/2023/01/18/crunchbot-sql-analyst-gpt/

You'll need an OpenAI API key and a Slack bot token authed against your organization.
