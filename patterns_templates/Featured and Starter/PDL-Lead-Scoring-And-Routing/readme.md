1. Ingest new leads via webhook
2. Enrich lead emails with external data from People Data Labs
3. Score each lead using a simple points based model 
4. Export each lead to Slack
5. Summarize all leads in a table and visualize using a chart 

### How it works
- Ingest new leads with a webhook
- Enrich lead emails with external data from People Data Labs
- Score each lead using a simple points based model 
- Route your high priority leads to Slack 
- Summarize all leads in a table and visualize using a chart 
- Optionally, you can also export to Google Sheets

This is an example of a simple configuration of lead scoring using a webhook as input and Slack channel as output. This template can be configured differently to ingest data from a database, CRM, or any API that contains your lead data. Additionally, you can also configure Patterns to export enriched and scored leads to your CRM, email marketing tool, or back to the database of your choice.
